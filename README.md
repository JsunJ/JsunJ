# üëã Hi there, I'm Jason!

I'm a software engineer passionate about problem-solving and life-long learning. With a strong background in IT infrastructure operations, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and perspective to teams.

Most recently, I developed [Providence](https://github.com/providence-replay), an open-source session replay framework leveraging advanced AI tools. Providence provides teams with rapid insights for improving their user experiences without needing to watch long session replays.
